# Covid-19 statistics is a react app that presents data about the pandemic around the world, using Rapid Api

The project uses Axios to do API calls and presents in diagrams the information (in quantity) about the Covid-19
(deaths, actives, criticals, recovered...) in each country and the whole world in general.

For the design, I used the libraries "React-chartjs-2" and "Material-ui" 

# Don't forget to replace the API key to yours (otherwise, it won't work)
