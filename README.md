# Covid-19 statistics is a react app that collects live data about the pandemic around the world

The project uses Axios to do API calls to RapidApi and presents the important information (in quantity) about the Covid-19
(deaths, actives, criticals, recovered...) in each country and the whole world in general.

for the design, I used the libraries "React-chartjs-2" and "Material-ui"
